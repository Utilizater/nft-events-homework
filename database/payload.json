IMHO it would be a good idea to use IOAM-Data-Fields throughout. Even draft-ietf-ippm-ioam-data-17 isn't really consistent - as there are quite a few places that use \"IOAM data fields\" instead. Something for clean-up by the RFC editor. \r\n* Section \"5.2.  IOAM Integrity Protection Algorithm Suite Registry\" is to list a set of suitable pairs of algorithms for signature and algorithm. Or in other terms, there could be more than a single set of algorithms being used. This contradicts with what we say in e.g., section 4.3.  \"Space optimized symmetric key based signing of IOAM data\" - where we have a MUST for AES-256 and  SHA-256. Would you mind cleaning this up as well by using a reference to 5.2 rather than referring to algorithm pairs directly in the spec?\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/inband-oam/ietf/issues/comments/1047051423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},{"push_id":9162592197,"size":1,"distinct_size":1,"ref":"refs/heads/main","head":"7517e398fe1fa39a570b8ce3a906df33a56c59d9","before":"8be1cbc1000c1e743d29fb7a00c3bf09285f6c09","commits":[{"sha":"7517e398fe1fa39a570b8ce3a906df33a56c59d9","author":{"email":"jp@bidega.in","name":"Jean-Philippe Bidegain"},"message":"chore: bump version","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aeyoll/mailboar/commits/7517e398fe1fa39a570b8ce3a906df33a56c59d9"}]},{"push_id":9162592136,"size":23,"distinct_size":9,"ref":"refs/heads/next","head":"d3c105fc12a9eeb7e876d086de016cae46039342","before":"680cf3e0ddd00b6726781c28fef6594a94f49cce","commits":[{"sha":"ebaf95051a6b1043cc77e303f32c496e8805d73c","author":{"email":"cassie@7596ff.com","name":"Cassandra McCarthy"},"message":"Merge branch 'main' into next","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/7596ff/twilight/commits/ebaf95051a6b1043cc77e303f32c496e8805d73c"},{"sha":"2f9f6f289e1616ea3c56e930817328de093b4530","author":{"email":"vilgot@fredenberg.xyz","name":"Vilgot Fredenberg"},"message":"refactor(cache)!: remove `Option` around known voice fields (#1503)\n\nThese are always present when the voice state is in the cache.","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/7596ff/twilight/commits/2f9f6f289e1616ea3c56e930817328de093b4530"},{"sha":"d808c1eb37a2cd6fd3e17361b9e46c159d95f8a6","author":{"email":"cassie@7596ff.com","name":"Cassandra McCarthy"},"message":"refactor(http,validate)!: move audit reason validation (#1527)\n\nRemoves `AuditLogReasonError` and its `Type`.

Issue link\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.hibernatingrhinos.com/issue/RavenDB-17760\r\n\r\n### Additional description\r\n\r\n- Introduce a new type of voron index - `DynamicBTreeIndexDef` - which allows to choose the indexing key based on the value\r\n- we will use this index to index items by their `bucket-id` + `etag` (bucket can be computed from the id column) \r\n- this will allow us to easily `GetItemsByBucket` (ordered by etag on the bucket level) for re-sharding purposes \r\n- made some abstraction and refactoring in `Table.cs` and `TableSchema.cs` to avoid code duplication (introduced new `AbstractBTreeIndexDef`)\r\n- made some name changes : `SchemaIndexDef => StaticBTreeIndexDef`, `FixedSizeSchemaIndexDef => FixedSizeTreeIndexDef`\r\n- other name suggestions are welcome :) \r\n\r\n### Type of change\r\n\r\n- New feature\r\n\r\n### How risky is the change?\r\n\r\n- Moderate \r\n\r\n### Backward compatibility\r\n\r\n- Not relevant\r\n\r\n### Is it platform specific issue?\r\n\r\n- No\r\n\r\n### Documentation update\r\n\r\n- No documentation update is needed \r\n\r\n### Testing \r\n\r\n- Tests have been added that prove the fix is effective or that the feature works\r\n- It has been verified by manual testing\r\n\r\n### Is there any existing behavior change of other features due to this change?\r\n\r\n- No\r\n\r\n### UI work\r\n\r\n- No UI work is
